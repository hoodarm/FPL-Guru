## What is FPL?
FPL is an online fantasy football game where participants, acting as virtual team managers, create teams using players from the Premier League. Players have different price tags based on their perceived skill and performance. With a budget constraint, participants must manage wisely to build competitive teams. Points are earned based on real-life player performances, including goals, assists, and clean sheets, while negative actions lead to deductions. Managers can change their team lineup weekly for added flexibility. (https://www.premierleague.com/news/2173986)
